# myAngular
My attempt to learn Angular 1.5.5

This project is based loosely on the '7 Minute Workout' in the book 'AngularJs by Example' by Chandermani (first four chapters so far).  I have created a photo album builder and something to run the created/edited albums. Right now, the albums are only saved to the browser cache.  I have a file explorer to load images from the app/img folder.  For now, images need to be loaded there. To run it I used what the book suggests - get node.js, from command line run 'npm install http-server -g' and then in the app folder 'http-server'.  Should be able to run this as http://localhost:8080. The main idea is to help me learn AngularJS.
